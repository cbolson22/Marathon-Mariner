# Marathon Mariner

Marathon Mariner is a fun and interactive app that combines fitness and fishing! Log your runs, earn coins based on your distance, and use those coins to "fish" for unique and collectible fish. Perfect for runners and fishing enthusiasts alike!

## Features
- **Log Your Runs:** Track your location while running, and earn 100 coins for every mile you run (e.g., 0.01 miles = 1 coin).
- **Catch Fish:** Use your earned coins to fish for different types of fish and add them to your collection.
- **Collections Page:** View all the fish you've caught, including:
  - **Quantity of Each Fish:** See how many of each type of fish you've collected.
  - **Biggest Fish:** Keep track of the largest fish you've caught (in terms of height and weight, as they vary).
- **Improved Fishing Rod:** The more miles you run, the better your fishing rod becomes, increasing your chances of catching rare fish.
